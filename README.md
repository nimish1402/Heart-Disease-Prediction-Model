# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
This project develops an ML model to predict heart disease by processing user-provided symptoms through a chatbot interface. It leverages structured data from the chatbot and symptom identification for accurate predictions.

#Key Features:
1- Chatbot-Based Data Structuring:
Utilizes a conversational chatbot to collect unstructured user data. Implements NLP techniques to structure this data for analysis.

2- Symptom Identification and Prediction:
Processes structured data to identify relevant heart disease symptoms. The ML model analyzes these symptoms to predict the likelihood of heart disease accurately.

#Implementation and Technology Stack:

NLP for chatbot development
ML algorithms (e.g., decision trees, neural networks) for symptom analysis
Python with TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NLTK, and Pandas
Web development tools for an intuitive chatbot UI
